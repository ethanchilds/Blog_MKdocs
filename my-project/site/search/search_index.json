MkDocs is a simple and lightweight static site generator, great for project documentation or blogs. MkDocs is built off of your basic markdown file and while this adds to the simplicity, it does come with some draw backs as it is restricted to just the functionalities that an md has. For example, unlike a Quarto document, we will not be able to render images just by adding R code blocks, instead we will need to render it beforehand and then add it to the repository. If the limitations of a markdown file doesn't work for your project, MkDocs is likely not the best option. For full documentation visit mkdocs.org .
